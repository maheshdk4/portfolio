# Complete Beginner's Guide to Your Portfolio Project

## üéØ What We Built

Your portfolio is now a **professional-grade cloud application** that demonstrates modern DevOps practices. Here's what it includes:

### 1. **Static Website** (Your Portfolio)
- `index.html` - Your resume/portfolio webpage
- `styles.css` - Makes it look professional
- `script.js` - Interactive features

### 2. **Containerization** (Docker)
- `Dockerfile` - Instructions to package your website
- `nginx.conf` - Web server configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Run locally with one command

### 3. **Kubernetes** (Container Orchestration)
- `k8s/` folder - Instructions for running in production
- Auto-scaling, load balancing, health checks

### 4. **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code)
- `terraform/` folder - Creates cloud infrastructure automatically
- Can deploy to AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud

## üîç Key Concepts Explained

### What is Docker?
Think of Docker like a **shipping container** for your application:
- Packages your website + web server + dependencies
- Runs the same way on any computer/server
- Lightweight and fast

### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is like a **smart manager** for containers:
- Runs multiple copies of your app (high availability)
- Automatically restarts failed containers
- Distributes traffic across healthy containers
- Scales up/down based on demand

### What is Terraform?
Terraform is like a **blueprint** for cloud infrastructure:
- Describes what servers, networks, databases you need
- Creates everything automatically
- Can recreate identical environments
- Version controlled like code

## üöÄ How to Use This Project

### Option 1: View Locally (Easiest)
```bash
# Just open the file in your browser
open index.html
```

### Option 2: Run with Docker (Intermediate)
```bash
# Install Docker Desktop first
# Then run:
docker-compose up
# Visit: http://localhost:8080
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Cloud (Advanced)
```bash
# Requires cloud account (AWS/Azure/GCP)
./scripts/terraform-deploy.sh apply
```
